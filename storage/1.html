    <span style="letter-spacing: -0;font-size: 15px">Our capitalization plan includes the offering of $250-350,000 in notes convertible to Class A shares, which has been subscribed and will close in the second week of May. The next element of the Company plan is to offer the Leaders and Members the opportunity to invest up to $400,000 in Notes convertible to Class B shares (non-voting). This offer will expire at the end of May, but can be extended at the Company option. The &nbsp;Notes carry an interest rate with quarterly payments that can be in cash or shares at the choice of the Company. Following these two offerings, we expect that the Company will be self-funding and not require additional capital until it registers its shares in a public offering. </span>

Chinese laws regarding how and when members may assemble and the activities that they may conduct, or the conditions under which the activities may be conducted, are subject to interpretations and enforcement that sometimes vary from province to province, among different levels of government, and from time to time. Members can be accused of violating one or more of the laws regulating these activities, notwithstanding training that we attempt to provide. Enforcement measures regarding these violations, which can include arrests, raise the uncertainty and perceived risk associated with conducting this business, especially among those who are aware of the enforcement actions but not the specific activities leading to the enforcement action.

    <span style="font-size: 15px">We expect that our business will be highly dependent on the secure and efficient functioning of our information technology systems, and the security of personal and sensitive business data. We expect to collect certain personal information, including payment data, from members and consumers, as well as our employees. We also expect to develop and maintain sensitive and proprietary business information. Any systems failure or interruption, breach in security, or loss of data, whatever the cause, could adversely affect our operations and financial results.</span>

    <span style="font-size: 15px">Systems disruptions and data breaches can derive from natural disasters, accidental technological events or human error, but can also result from fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that our proposed systems, networks and software, like those of other companies, are likely to be the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from isolated or random attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed specifically at us. The risk of a systems disruption or data breach, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. A material systems disruption or data breach affecting us could damage our reputation, deter members from purchasing our products, and result in cost and liability to us.</span>

<p style="text-indent:38px;line-height:17px">
    <span style="font-size: 15px">Although we intend to implement technical and administrative safeguards to maintain the security and integrity of our proposed information technology systems and data, there can be no assurance that any such security efforts and measures will be effective in a continually evolving threat environment. In addition to the risks presented by malicious actors and natural disasters, many systems disruptions and data breaches are reportedly caused by human error. Therefore, our proposed systems and data will be exposed to the risk that human error could either create a vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker, or expose our systems and data to unintended risk of compromise. In addition, as described below, we expect that most of our information technology systems and data will be hosted by third-party vendors over which we have limited control. We anticipate that we will be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance our technical and administrative safeguards, and to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities in our systems, networks and software.</span>

    <span style="font-size: 15px">In any case, a data breach or other significant disruption of our information systems or those related to our third party vendors, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could (1) disrupt the proper functioning of our systems and networks and therefore operations, (2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of personal, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable data or other information, (3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, cybersecurity, data breach notification requirements under applicable laws, regulations and contractual provisions, subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and exposing us to possible fines, lawsuits and related financial liability, (4) require significant management attention and financial resources to investigate and remedy the breach or disruption, and (5) harm our reputation, cause a decrease in the number of our members and revenue, and otherwise damage our business. &nbsp;The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.</span>
